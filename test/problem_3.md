Add your answer to problem 3 below.

For the first video one thing I learned from the video is to try not to miss out on
any given opptunities. The speaker in the video talks mostly in the context of
the economy and what to buy or save.
By weighing what are your potential gains and losses
from taking that oppuntinities the video presenter tries to motivate the viewer
by talking about some ways to be more successful is to get a way to measure your
improvement or missed opptunities. If you can measure your growth and 
improvement you can potentially motive yourself to improve and use those 
measure to improve yourself in the future. This video was very eye
opening because even if he wasn't talking about content that I at first expected
it was a good way to learn some advice on how to improve and be successful in life
even outside the context of money.


For the second video one thing I learned was talking about the use cases 
and importance of testing. The video talks about that not only do tests
give you confidence that your code is working in certain edge cases but
also can help drive what your program should be doing. TDD or test
driven programing can help understand the database your are coding
from will be able to use and helps gets things done by seeing what
you are getting wrong. I also think testing at first was pretty tiring chore
but it helps let you see what you are doing wrong and pinpoint the problems.
