Throughout the first video it was mainly talking about FOMO, which means the “Fear of Missing out”. One topic that, really interested me throughout this lecture was when Dr.SteenBarger was talking about the “desire to learn and grow”. Basically Dr.SteenBarger was talking about previous students and their “trading” habits back when they were much younger, and the students that did have that desire to learn and grow, and showcased the progress they have made. This interested me because I was thinking about incorporating this into my own learning, starting by uploading all my projects online hopefully to a personal github repository and seeing at the end of the year how much my skills as a developer has improved. Which hopefully by the end of the year it will give me greater motivation to grow even further, and learn even more.


Throughout the second video, I learned a lot about test driven development. Throughout the video it gave me a different perspective on looking through how to solve problems as well as larger scale projects. When you start developing tests before you start implementing your code etc. It can give you a good roadmap as to what you need to complete. Before you know it, as you pass through every test and you finish you are technically done with the tasks assigned to you. In summary, this video taught me how developing tests are a interesting and effective way to code and finish problems.
